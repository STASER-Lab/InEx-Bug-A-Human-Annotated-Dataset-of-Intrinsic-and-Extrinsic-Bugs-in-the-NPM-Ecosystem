yannickcr_eslint-plugin-react,1717,Spaces get condensed by --fix when they are alone in a <span>,"We often need to add spacing between two elements in JSX. For example:

```jsx
<GenericTextComponent type='test' />
<span>{' '}</span>
<GenericTextComponent type='other' />
```

Applying `--fix` turns the code into this:
```jsx
<GenericTextComponent type='test' />
<span />
<GenericTextComponent type='other' />
```
which is not the same thing.

I think I've traced down what's happening. The code above gives off this error:
```
error  Curly braces are unnecessary here  react/jsx-curly-brace-presence
```

Which, when corrected (by removing the curly braces and quotes), gives off another error:
```
error  Empty components are self-closing  react/self-closing-comp
```

which `--fix` happily turns into the `<span />` above.

sindresorhus_file-type,320,PNG with long iTXt chunk not detected as PNG image,"Some PNG images have long `iTXt` chunks so the parser never reaches `IDAT` chunk.

```
{ length: 13, type: 'IHDR' }

A solution perhaps would be to add a final return after [this line](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type/blob/master/core.js#L887) in case the PNG header matches, but no `IDAT` chunk is found in first 4100 bytes. Or perhaps an extra switch case for `ITXt` chunk?

-   Node Version (`node -v`): v12.1.0
-   NPM Version (`npm -v`): 6.9.0

### Description:

I have set up a clean new project with laravel and now trying to add the [cash-dom](https://github.com/kenwheeler/cash) package to this project. Sadyl I get an error when opening the served browser url.

```
[Vue warn]: Error in mounted hook: ""TypeError: $ is not a function""

```

### Steps To Reproduce:

1. `laravel new test`
2. `npm install cash-dom --save-dev`
3. Add `mix.autoload({  'cash-dom': ['$'] })` to webpack.mix.js
4. Add `console.log($(""body""))` to the example component

standard_standard,1314,New rule: Disallow assignments that can lead to race conditions due to usage of await or yield (require-atomic-updates),"https://eslint.org/docs/rules/require-atomic-updates

This was surprising to me. Apparently the following code contains a race condition:

```js
let totalLength = 0;

async function addLengthOfSinglePage(pageNum) {
  totalLength += await getPageLength(pageNum);
}

Promise.all([addLengthOfSinglePage(1), addLengthOfSinglePage(2)]).then(() => {
  console.log('The combined length of both pages is', totalLength);
});
```

Ecosystem impact: Only one repo failed. Looks to be a false positive. Reported here: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11954 This carries some amount of false positive risk (at least based on what I've seen on the eslint tracker). I'd like to enable this in `standard` 13 and see how it goes.

JeffreyWay_laravel-mix,1178,Typescript with commonjs module loader,"- Laravel Mix Version: 1.4.2
- Node Version: 8.4.0
- Yarn Version: 1.0.1
- OS: OSx Sierra

### Description:

    ""target"": ""ES5"",
    ""module"": ""commonjs"",

    ""sourceMap"": true,
    ""outDir"": ""build/""
  },
  ""exclude"": [
    ""node_modules""
  ]
}
```

(Note the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` settings is enabled as recommended by Vue)

```typescript
// app.ts
import Vue from ""vue""

console.dir(Vue)

const app = new Vue({
    el: ""#app"",
    template: `
    <strong>
      Hello World!
    </strong>`
})
```

It should be possible to use `commonjs` as module loader for Typescript.
However, running `mix.ts()` breaks this somehow, as the result in the browser is the following.

`console.dir(): undefined`

With the following error:

```
app.js:83 Uncaught TypeError: vue_1.Vue is not a constructor
    at Object._toString (app.js:83)
    at __webpack_require__ (app.js:20)

    at __webpack_require__ (app.js:20)
    at app.js:63
    at app.js:66
```

I've tried setting up a webpack configuration for typescript and run it on the same `app.ts` file with the same `tsconfig.json` (and aswell with `ts-loader` as used in laravel-mix).

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: ""./app.ts"",
  output: {
    filename: ""app.js"",
    path: __dirname + ""/dist""
  },
  devtool: ""source-map"",
  resolve: {
    extensions: ["".ts"", "".tsx"", "".js"", "".json"", "".vue""],
    alias: {
      'vue$': 'vue/dist/vue.esm.js'
    }
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: ""ts-loader""
      },
      {
        enforce: ""pre"",
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: ""source-map-loader""
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

That way it works like a charm without any errors.  
This seems to be a problem in laravel mix.

The [shorthand for defining a generator method in an object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions) is sometimes parsed as a function.

Currently we are working on the [upgrading to Webpack4 in Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/2901), we met this issue in SSR font-preloading.

After some investigations, I found the issue was caused by two reasons.

1. Webpack module assets is null, I have opened a pr https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6640 (**merged**)
2. Webpack ConcatenatedModule has changed module identifier to `request   additional hash`, but `vue-loader` is still using `request`.

    * [`ConcatenatedModule identifier`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/ConcatenatedModule.js#L434)

    * [`SSR plugin is using identifier which has been modified by ConcatenatedModule`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/server/webpack-plugin/client.js#L46)

    * [`vue-loader is using request`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/blob/master/lib/loader.js#L250)

I'm not very sure the fix should be done in vue-ssr or vue-loader, so just opened issue here, we can have a discussion and figure out the solution 😸

prettier_prettier,5447,Suggested improvement for Vim+ALE integration,"**Environments:**
- Prettier Version: 1.15.2
- Running Prettier via: neovim+ALE
- Runtime: Node 10.12.0
- Operating System: GNU/Linux

**Steps to reproduce:**
:wave: hello there, I'm a neovim+ALE user, and after following the steps in [the documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/vim.html#ale-https-githubcom-w0rp-ale) I was unable to make *prettier* working for my setup.

TL;DR, I've added those lines to my `$MYVIMRC`:

```
Plug 'w0rp/ale'

let g:ale_fixers = {
\   'javascript': ['prettier'],
\   'css': ['prettier'],
\}

let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
```

**Expected behavior:**
The expected behavior was to have ALE running prettier, and format the file on save.

**Actual behavior:**
[Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) was running instead :confused:.

**Possible solution:**
After digging a bit, I found this in the [ALE FAQ](https://github.com/w0rp/ale#5i-how-do-i-disable-particular-linters):

> By default, all available tools for all supported languages will be run. If you want to only select a subset of the tools, you can define `b:ale_linters` for a single buffer, or `g:ale_linters globally`.
[...]
If you don't want ALE to run anything other than what you've explicitly asked for, you can set `g:ale_linters_explicit` to 1.

By adding `let g:ale_linters_explicit = 1` to my `$MYVIMRC` I was finally able to use *prettier* :tada:.

If that's the correct approach, I can make a PR to update the documentation, what do you think?",https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5447,Not  a Bug,,
micromatch_nanomatch,20,Trailing slash discrepancy with micromatch,"## Please describe the **minimum necessary steps** to reproduce this issue:

```js
const micromatch = require('micromatch'); // version must be >= 4.0.1
console.log(micromatch(['/test/t/'], ['**/t/']));
// [ '/test/t/' ]
console.log(micromatch(['/test/t/'], ['**/t']));
// []

const nm = require('nanomatch');
console.log(nm(['/test/t/'], ['**/t/']));
// [ '/test/t/' ]
console.log(nm(['/test/t/'], ['**/t']));
// [ '/test/t/' ]
```

## What is happening:

`micromatch` takes into account the trailing slash and do an exact match
`nanomatch` doesn't take it into account and match even without trailing slash in the pattern

## What should be happening instead?

Both libraries should be aligned on this behaviour. From this [previous issue on micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/128) about trailing slashes, I believe we will want the fix to be done here in nanomatch.

## Additional info

As `micromatch` switched from `nanomatch` to `picomatch` in v4.x (during [this refactor](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/commit/52df06d08c2cd41b8ded6f30a1d7e69dde89b8ca#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R39)), `micromatch`'s behaviour has actually changed between `v3.1.10` and `v4.0.1`. It was previously behaving like `nanomatch`.
Again, after reading the discussion about the trailing slashes linked above, I believe we want to keep its new behaviour, so an additional unit test could be added in micromatch to be sure to stay consistent in the future.",https://github.com/micromatch/nanomatch/issues/20,Extrinsic,Switched from Micromatch to pictomatch/. causing bugs,"From the perspective of Nanomatch, i think this could be a non-bug as the user is asking to nanomatch to change to be in accordance with micromatch"

I'm trying to get the acorn-jsx parser plugin (https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx) to work via acornInjectPlugins (an acknowledged experimental property). Could be a problem with Rollup, Acorn, or Acorn-JSX -- hard to tell from here, but this seems like the recommended standard path to implement Rollup-JSX support without additional tooling.

It parses JSX and rolls up ES6 modules.

indutny_elliptic,24,Different S in elliptic and secp256k1,"Hi.
That's probably not an issue with `elliptic` but maybe you will give a hint or some help.

I compare signatures for the same message and private key generated with `elliptic` and [secp256k1-node](https://github.com/wanderer/secp256k1-node). Sometimes I get the same result (output in DER format), sometimes not.

Example code:

``` js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var crypto = require(""crypto"");
var secp256k1 = require(""secp256k1"");
var EC = require(""elliptic"").ec;

var ec = new EC(""secp256k1"");
var privateKey = new Buffer(32);
privateKey.fill(1);
var publicKey = secp256k1.createPublicKey(privateKey);

function signWithSecp256k1(msg) {
  return secp256k1.sign(privateKey, msg);
}

function verifyWithSecp256k1(msg, sig) {
  return secp256k1.verify(publicKey, msg, sig) === 1;
}

function signWithElliptic(msg) {
  return new Buffer(ec.sign(msg, privateKey).toDER());
}

function verifyWithElliptic(msg, sig) {
  return ec.verify(msg, sig, publicKey);
}

function start() {
  var msg = process.argv[2];
  if (!msg) {
    console.log(""No message provided"");
    process.exit(1);
  }
  msg = crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(msg).digest();
  console.log(""Message:"", msg.toString(""hex""));

  var sigFromSecp256k1 = signWithSecp256k1(msg);
  var hsigFromSecp256k1 = sigFromSecp256k1.toString(""hex"");
  var sigFromElliptic = signWithElliptic(msg);
  var hsigFromElliptic = sigFromElliptic.toString(""hex"");

  console.log(""Signature from secp256k1:"", hsigFromSecp256k1);
  console.log(""Signature from elliptic:"", hsigFromElliptic);

To: 

```
new ExtractTextPlugin('css/[name]-[hash].css', {

reduxjs_redux,3337,Problems with identical arrays,"Hi, I found a weird bug.

Redux package version is 4.0.1.

So I have two somewhat identical arrays in my initial state:
```
{
   items: [],
   userItems: []
}
```

Brief explanation why I have these two, both of them are array of objects, they contain similar keys such as id, name and checked. ""items"" is more of a reference to the ""userItems"", and ""userItems"" is the user's preference to the ""items"". I separated them so that when the user logs out, I only have to clear the ""userItems"" but retain the ""items"" so I can reference it again when another user logs in.

Here's how the structure looks like with data.
```
{
   items: [{
      id: 2,
      order: 1,
      name: ""xxx"",
      title: ""xxx"",
      description: ""xxx"",
      checked: false // This can be true or false if server wants them pre-checked when user registers
   },
   ...
   ],
   userItems: [{
      id: 2,
      name: ""xxx"",
      checked: true
   },
   ...
   ],
}
```

I have a reducer called `USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE`:


```
import {
  NEWSLETTERS_GET,
  USER_NEWSLETTERS_GET,
  USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE,
  USER_LOG_OUT,
} from '../actions/types';

const initialState = {
  items: [],
  hasItems: false,
  userItems: [],
  hasUserItems: false,
};

export default function(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case NEWSLETTERS_GET:
      return {
        ...state,
        items: action.payload,
        hasItems: true,
      };
    case USER_NEWSLETTERS_GET:
    case USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE:
      return {
        ...state,
        userItems: action.payload,
        hasUserItems: true,
      };
    case USER_LOG_OUT:
      return {
        ...state,
        userItems: [],
        hasUserItems: false,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

When I dispatched the action `USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE`  to update the userItems, noticed that the items was somehow updated, here's the actual screenshot of the weird bug by checking the redux dev tools:

sindresorhus_got,1186,allowGetBody payload is dropped by .paginate(),"this is a spinoff of #1171 

 - Node.js version: 12.16.1
 - OS & version: latest MacOQ

since got@11.0.0, `.paginate()` no longer send the body (json payload) of an `allowGetBody` query

#### Actual behavior

the json payload (a filter expression) is not sent to the server which returns the whole set of records

#### Expected behavior

Like in got@10.x the server should only return the records matching the filter (i.e. the json payload)

#### Code to reproduce

I have two simple allowGetBody test cases. In order to run, `test/helpers/with-server.ts` needs to be changed in lines 16-20:

```typescript
	const server = await createTestServer({
		bodyParser: {
			// type: () => false
		}
	}) as ExtendedTestServer;
```

This enable the bodyParser middleware to properly populate `request.body`. Because I do not fathom the possible impact of above change, I won't issue a PR.

First a simple and successful test

```typescript
test('allowGetBody sends json payload', withServer, async (t, server, got) => {
	server.get('/', (request, response) => {
		if (request.body.hello !== 'world') {
			response.statusCode = 400;
		}

		response.end();
	});

	const {statusCode} = await got({
		allowGetBody: true,
		json: {hello: 'world'},
		retry: 0,
		throwHttpErrors: false
	});
	t.is(statusCode, 200);
});
```

Now with .paginate() (it fails)

```typescript
test('allowGetBody sends json payload with .paginate()', withServer, async (t, server, got) => {
	server.get('/', (request, response) => {
		if (request.body.hello !== 'world') {
			response.statusCode = 400;
		}

		response.end(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]));
	});

	const iterator = got.paginate({
		allowGetBody: true,
		json: {hello: 'world'},
		retry: 0
	});

	const result = await iterator.next();

	t.is(result.value, 1);
});
```

reduxjs_redux,2427,"Unnecessary ""Unexpected key ..."" warning when merging combined reducers","**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**  

A bug... maybe.  It seems like it's intended behaviour but I don't know who benefits from the warning.

It is similar to #1636, but not caused by `replaceReducers`, but by wanting to merge the state from seperate reducers, which have been combined with `combineReducers`.

**What is the current behavior?**

When `combineReducers` receives keys it doesn't know about it produces a warning stating

> Unexpected key ""additional"" found in previous state received by the reducer. Expected to find one of the known reducer keys instead: ""known"". Unexpected keys will be ignored.

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**

[Here is a codepen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xdNgPB) with a simplified example of what I'm doing.

**What is the expected behavior?**

I would not expect to see this warning, as I believe that merging state from multiple reducers is a valid use case for Redux.  Even one of the [examples in the Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html#sharing-data-between-slice-reducers) would have the same issue if the `crossSliceReducer` added a new key rather than overriding an existing one.

I don't really understand who is benefitting from this warning.  If it was warning about a missing key (after it has previously been there and there was a slice reducer expecting it) I would understand that that is something that is unusual and probably a bug, but I don't see much harm in having additional nodes that the reducer is just going to ignore anyway.

**Which versions of Redux, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Redux?**

I am unsure which version of Redux introduced the warning and why, but it is still present in 3.6.0",https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/2427,Not  a Bug,,

OverZealous_run-sequence,42,gulp.watch only runs once when passed a run-sequence task,"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31593582/gulp-watch-only-runs-once-when-passed-a-run-sequence-task

I have a [gulpfile](https://github.com/tonyeung/angular-gulp-bower-seed/blob/master/gulpfile.js), it uses run sequence and gulp.watch().

When I make a change to a file, the watch task will run the task I specified exactly once. In this case, the task that should be executed is ""run"", which is the same as the default task except it doesn't run the dev server and watch task again. Nothing happens when I make further edits, whether in the same file or a different one, for example, the [index.html](https://github.com/tonyeung/angular-gulp-bower-seed/blob/master/src/app/common/templates/index.html) file

If I pass gulp.watch a plain gulp task (without run sequence), for example the clean task, then the watch will run the clean task every time.

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but I don't understand what. I think something might be silently erroring and disconnecting the stream, but I can't figure out how to debug this.",https://github.com/OverZealous/run-sequence/issues/42,Not  a Bug,,

### Description:

When installing vuetify I need to compile the stylus assets. When the assets are compiling I get the following errors:

```
error  in ./node_modules/vuetify/src/stylus/components/_selection-controls.styl

Module parse failed: /Users/dan/Code/Sites/practiceo/practiceo/node_modules/vuetify/src/stylus/components/_selection-controls.styl Unexpected character '@' (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
| @import '../bootstrap'
| @import '../theme'

```

The initial import works correctly but the succeeding imports cause errors.

### Steps To Reproduce:

Install vuetify: `yarn add vuetify`

Create the stylus entry point (`resources/assets/stylus/app.styl`) with the following content:

```
@import '../../../node_modules/vuetify/src/stylus/app'
```

## Suggestion
I feel the code here: https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/blob/master/index.js#L459 can be changed to the following:
```js
process.exitCode && process.exit(process.exitCode); // ensures that code coverage is enforced correctly

The existing check on process.version will result in the exit code constraint being satisfied for Node `v0.10.x` - `0.11.x` only.

-   Node Version: v12.16.1 
-   NPM Version: 6.13.4

### Description:

The test failing on `features/vue.js` features.

It seems the file read happens before the mix (nearly) finish building the file.

E.g.

```
File.find('test/fixtures/fake-app/public/css/components.css').read()
```

Since when I try to add delay with some setTimeout and async/await, it passes.

I didn't see the tests failing on TravisCI, so (maybe) it only happens on my end? Just curious maybe others can reproduce this issue as well.

`typeface-lato` is a package which `main` field in `package.json` is a `.css` file.

gulp-sourcemaps_gulp-sourcemaps,284,mapSources behave different in Linux with node v6.9.2 and Windows with node  v7.7.1,"NOTE: I don't think the the title describe my issue! sorry

I have a Windows machine with node v7.7.1 and a Linux vm with node v6.9.2. I have a typescript project that we compile and append inline sourcemaps using gulp-sourcemaps. To make Visual Studio Code debugger work properly, I had to add a mapSource conversion, here is part of the code

```
gulp.task('compile:typescript', ['clean'], () => (
  tsProject.src()
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(tsProject())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write({
      mapSources: (sourcePath, file) => {
        let converted = sourcePath;

        try {
          const absJsPath = path.dirname(file.path);
          const absTsPath = path.resolve('dist', sourcePath.toString());

          converted = path.relative(absJsPath, absTsPath);
          console.log('sourceMap', sourcePath.toString(), converted);
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(e);
        } finally {
          return converted;
        }
      }
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.tscripts.dest))
));
```

That conversion works in the Linux vm, but i windows throw the following error:

The problem is that sourceMap function is not receiving the same arguments in Linux and Window. On Windows, the second parameter `file` of sourceMap function is 0 instead of a buffer.

reduxjs_redux,3672,createStore should perhaps accept preloadedState: PreloadedState<S> | S,"At least as of `4.0.5`, `createStore` accepts `preloadedState: PreloadedState<S>`. One imagines that one can pass `S` to `preloadedState`, and in most cases this is correct. However, there are cases in which `S` is not assignable to `PreloadedState<S>`, at least since `typescript@3.6.3`. See https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/35992 for more information on this issue. It's unclear to me whether https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/35992 is a typescript bug, but I'm wondering if `createStore` should accept `preloadedState: PreloadedState<S> | S`, which would mitigate the issue of branded types being mapped to `never`.",https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3672,Not  a Bug,,

shellscape_webpack-manifest-plugin,168,Running manifest causes emits otherwise unmodified files,"I didn't see a template for posting here, and I also am not sure if this is the appropriate space. This is a pretty specific issue/question and I apologize if it belongs elsewhere. Please delete this if it is the case.

I'm developing for WordPress, and am using multiple entry points to compile my sass and JavaScript. Because you're supposed to enqueue your scripts using `wp_enqueue_script`, I am reading the manfiest file and using the file specified using the manifest (basic stuff). However, while I'm running webpack --watch, I'm also using BrowserSync to proxy to my valet install so that I can reload changes to my php and twig files. This part works well.

However, I've configured browser-sync-webpack-plugin with `injectCss: true` which injects the CSS instead of reloading the entire page. This works well, as long as I don't have the manifest plugin included. Through further investigation, I realized that when I'm using this plugin, it emits my main.js file in addition to the css files generated.

This isn't because I'm including the scss files in my javascript, because I'm using  a scss only entry point and also using webpack-fix-style-only-entries to prevent a js file from being emitted for a css only (minus webpack bootstrapping) file. Additionally, manipulating the same files with the manifest plugin doesn't result in javascript output which lets the browsersync injectCSS option work fine.

I don't fully understand how webpack plugins work, but is there a way to prevent the plugin from emitting files that weren't compiled as a part of the process or to run once (or some other configurable number of times)?

Potentially important parts from my webpack config: (I've excluded those I anticipate are unnecessary, so please let me know if I've missed something)

yannickcr_eslint-plugin-react,1782,[react/jsx-filename-extension] Restrict .js extension,"This is regarding the rule: 
https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md

There are a few comments I read that convinced me to use `.js` extensions for my react components (that contains jsx) including 
1. [Dan abramov's comment here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/985#issuecomment-239145468).
2. Also the create-react-app project now encourages `.js` extension for react components.

So If I'm going ahead with this, I wanted to enforce this for our codebase because our tooling will no longer read `jsx` files anymore.

Taking this from the documentation:
```
""react/jsx-filename-extension"": [1, { ""extensions"": ["".js"", "".jsx""] }]
```
I though, maybe if I modify the `extensions` array to be just `"".js""` it might work.
```
""react/jsx-filename-extension"": [1, { ""extensions"": ["".js""] }]
```

but it didn't. What could be the reason for that ?

Since this is a pretty generic rule that says in it's documentation:

I cannot get golang to produce the same result for `encryptionKey` using the standard golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519 library.

Keys are the same on both sides.

My only assumption is that your curve implementation is off or is a different variant.

I switched to https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js and used the keyPair + scalarMult with zero issues.

Original code:
```js
const selectRedirectionQuery = () => createSelector(
  selectRoute(),
  (routingState) => routingState.getIn(['locationBeforeTransitions', 'query', 'redirect'])
);
```

Output (options: ` --trailing-comma=true --bracket-spacing=true --single-quote=true`):
```js
const selectRedirectionQuery = () =>
  createSelector(selectRoute(), routingState =>
    routingState.getIn(['locationBeforeTransitions', 'query', 'redirect']));
```

Expected one of these, depending on the closure's length:
```js
const selectRedirectionQuery = () =>
  createSelector(
    selectRoute(),
    routingState =>
      routingState.getIn(['locationBeforeTransitions', 'query', 'redirect'])
  );
```
```js
const selectRedirectionQuery = () =>
  createSelector(
    selectRoute(),
    routingState => routingState.getIn(['locationBeforeTransitions', 'query', 'redirect'])
  );
```

The current output seems to me to be really hard to parse correctly.",https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/585,Not  a Bug,,

waysact_webpack-subresource-integrity,14,[Bug] thisCompilation.mainTemplate is never hit,"Using this plugin in our webpack build produces no difference to the output `webpackJsonp` function. After some debugging, it looks as if the code within the `this-compilation` plugin is never getting called.

If I change the following lines:

```js
  compiler.plugin('compilation', function compilationPlugin(compilation) {
    /*
     * Double plug-in registration in order to push our
     * plugin to the end of the plugin stack.
     */
    compiler.plugin('this-compilation', function thisCompilationPlugin(thisCompilation) {

To this:

```js
  compiler.plugin('compilation', function compilationPlugin(compilation) {

     * plugin to the end of the plugin stack.
     */

reduxjs_redux,3468,"""Invalid descriptor for property 'dispatch'"" in IE11","**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

Bug.

**What is the current behavior?**

With Redux 4.0.2 and up, IE11 throws up an error on load of ""Invalid descriptor for property 'dispatch'."" The script debugger flags 570,9 in redux.js as the source of the error (which appears to be inside the _objectSpread2(target) function. I don't think this is the source of the error itself as that function exists within previous versions of Redux and seems unchanged between versions. Redux 4.0.1 works fine and does not have this issue.

**What is the expected behavior?**

Redux works normally as expected.

**Which versions of Redux, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Redux?**

istanbuljs_nyc,950,Coverage for nyc executed outside current working directory,"Hi,

I have a lerna repo using npm's relatively new ""file:"" dependency feature to load resources from parent directories. For a given package when I run ""npm run test"" within a package it should use nyc/mocha from ../../node_modules/.bin.

`    
    ""test:unit"": ""NODE_ENV=test ../../node_modules/.bin/mocha ./src/*.spec.js ./src/**/*.spec.js"",
    ""coverage:unit"": ""../../node_modules/.bin/nyc -- npm run test:unit"",
`

If I install nyc globally (wish to avoid) and run directly (without ../../node_modules/.bin/nyc) **files are be covered correctly**. However when running as above only one file will show coverage.

I've tried the --cmd param (which --help shows correctly as the package dir) and also various combinations of ""include"".

Here's my nyc (13.1.0) config:

`
  ""nyc"": {
    ""sourceMap"": false,

### How Do We Reproduce?

<!--
  Issues without minimal reproductions will be closed! Please provide one by:
  1. Using the REPL at https://rollupjs.org/repl, or
  2. Work to isolate the problem and provide the exact steps in this issue, or
  3. Provide a minimal repository link (Read https://git.io/fNzHA for instructions).
     These may take more time to triage than the other options.
-->
Create a simple plugin which uses the `generateBundle` hook to read output file:

```js
const fs = require('fs')

module.exports = () => ({
  generateBundle({ file }, _, isWrite) {
    if (isWrite) {
      fs.readFileSync(file) // Error because it does not exist yet!
    }
  }
})
```

This should be a bug since `onwrite` hook works as expected but it's deprecated in favor of this.


### Expected Behavior

Should be able to access output files when `isWrite` is `true`.


### Actual Behavior

No output files.

It seems `generateBundle` hook is always executed in the `generate` function:

https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/4f192335f2cac82897c457ac6cd0d524036ccd5b/src/rollup/index.ts#L293

while `writeOutputFile` is called after that:

postcss_postcss-calc,40,Cannot wrap inner value in negative,"Not sure how to title this issue correctly, but the issue is if you do something like

When the `socket hang up` occurs, it is immediately thrown so the promise returned by got immediately rejects. But as timeouts are not cleared, you will get an unhandled promise rejection after the time set in your timeout.

#### Code to reproduce

You need a `socket hang up` to see the bug. A good manner to have one if to put `socket.destroy();` [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/blob/master/source/utils/timed-out.ts#L108). It's a simulation, but I can generate the same stack trace as my real life application where ""true"" `socket hang up`s sometimes occur.
```js
'use strict';

const got = require('got');

const gotOptions = {
	timeout: 1000,
	retry: 0
};
got('https://google.com', gotOptions)
	.catch((e) => {
		console.log(e.message)
	});

setTimeout(() => {}, 5000);

-->

- Laravel Mix Version: 1.6.1
- Node Version: 8.9.1
- NPM Version: 5.5.1
- OS: macOS 10.13.1

### Description:
Calling `mix.sourceMaps(true, 'source-map')` will not cause `source-map` to be set as the preferred type when building for production. Instead, `cheap-source-map` will be used. Furthermore, no source maps are emitted for javascript bundles in production builds regardless; they are only emitted for bundled css.

I modified [the sourceMaps method in Api.js](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/blob/master/src/Api.js#L377-L385) as follows to force my own map type preference to be honored during both production and development builds, but javascript source maps are still not emitted.

```javascript
   sourceMaps(productionToo = true, type) {
        if (Mix.inProduction() && !productionToo) {
            // No production source maps!
            type = false;
        }  else if (Mix.inProduction() && typeof type === 'undefined') {
            // Unspecified type preference, fall back to the prod default.
            type = 'cheap-source-map';
        } else if (typeof type === 'undefined') {
            // Not in prod, and no type preference. Fall back to the dev default.
            type = 'inline-source-map';
        }

        Config.sourcemaps = type;

        return this;
    };
```

I plan to continue investigating this issue myself, since I need full sourcemaps for prod builds to send to Bugsnag. But any advice would be greatly appreciated.

### Steps To Reproduce:

<!-- 

Your issue will be addressed much more quickly if you can provide us exact steps to reproduce the problem from scratch.

-->

Configure `webpack.mix.js` to bundle up some javascript, and pass in a source map type to the `sourceMaps` method. The resulting build will not have source maps of the type specified. My build doesn't have javascript source maps at all, but I can't tell if that's the same issue.

I have an error since I tried to run the command `npm run prod` before pushing a project in production.
**This error does not occurs when I run `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`.**

    ""cross-env"": ""^4.0.0"",
    ""laravel-mix"": ""0.*"",
    ""lodash"": ""^4.17.4""
  }
}
```

Here is my webpack.mix.js content that cause the error (everything else is commented) :
```
const { mix } = require('laravel-mix');

mix.scripts([
  'resources/assets/js/front/app.front.js'
], 'public/js/app.front.js');

Here is the console message when I run `npm run prod` :

It looks like `babel-eslint` was moved to `devDependencies` in this commit: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-selector-parser/commit/01f6b22f2eb99e8e93aef228f6cccf912d56709f#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2

Do you think it would be possible to release a new version to npm with the fix?

Unfortunately having multiple babel versions (babel-eslint 8.2.3 is pulling in @babel/*-beta.beta.44) is messing with my dev environment...

reduxjs_redux,1585,Update React component by dispatching action from non-react component,"Hi

I'm trying to update the cart-button on a project when the user adds an item to the cart.

I have build parts of the site in React.js - like the cart, the cart button etc. I'm dispatching an action that is supposed to update the card quantity from a non-react component like this:

```
import { dispatch } from 'redux';
import { updateCart } from '../../actions/cart_actions';
import configureStore from '../../store/configureStore'
var store = configureStore();
```

and then..

```
store.dispatch(updateCart(response));
```

The action **is dispatched** and **the state is updated**. The cart-button component is connected via. react-redux connect() function. But somehow it isn't updating the component with the new quantity.

When I dispatch an action from within my cart React component it works fine.

I might be missing something obvious. Any suggestions?",https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/1585,Not  a Bug,,

  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({type: SAVE_ANSWER})

    return dispatch(postRequest(ANSWERS_ENDPOINT, {id, answer}))
  }
}
```
I want to stub postRequest so that it's logic is not executed (it uses `dispatch` internally).

I have setup for spec:
```javascript
import configureMockStore from 'redux-mock-store'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import * as ACTIONS from '../answers'
import * as HTTP_ACTIONS from '../http'

const mockStore = configureMockStore([thunk])
const store = mockStore({})

describe('saveAnswer()', () => {
  it('test', () => {
    sinon.stub(HTTP_ACTIONS, 'postRequest').returns(Promise.resolve({}))

    store.dispatch(ACTIONS.saveAnswer(ID, ANSWER))
  })
})
```
When I run spec I get this error: `Error: Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions.`

I don't understand what am I doing wrong but it has to do something with stubbing postRequest action.

reduxjs_redux,2740,Incorrect typescript typings for middlewares,"Hi. It looks like typings don't work nicely for middlewares because I can't use type of state in it, because it's type is `S` (see the comment in code):

```typescript
import * as redux from 'redux';

interface State {
    app: {
        title: string;
    }
}

const initialState: State = {
    app: {
        title: 'awesome app',
    }
}

function createMiddleware(): redux.Middleware {
    return function<S>(api: redux.MiddlewareAPI<S>) {
        return function (next: redux.Dispatch<S>): redux.Dispatch<S> {
            return function (action) {
                const state = api.getState();
                // error is shown here because `app` does not exist on type `S`
                console.log('app title: ', state.app.title);

                next(action);
            };
        };
    }
}

function appReducer(state: State, action) {
    return state;
}

redux.createStore(
    appReducer,
    initialState,
    redux.applyMiddleware(createMiddleware())
)
```

My colleague advised me to extend `redux.Middleware` but then typings don't work either because following code should fail to compile, but it compiles just fine (see the comment in code):
```typescript
import * as redux from 'redux';

interface State {
    app: {
        title: string;
    }
}

export interface Middleware extends redux.Middleware {
    (api: redux.MiddlewareAPI<State>): (next: redux.Dispatch<State>) => redux.Dispatch<State>;
}

function createMiddleware(): Middleware {
    return function(api: redux.MiddlewareAPI<State>) {
        return function (next: redux.Dispatch<State>): redux.Dispatch<State> {
            return function (action) {
                const state = api.getState();
                // `state` is of type `State2` which doesn't have `app` property, but typescript happily compiles this
                console.log('app title: ', state.app.title);

                next(action);
            };
        };
    }
}

interface State2 {
    wtf: string;
}

const initialState2: State2 = {
    wtf: 'ttf'
}

function appReducer(state: State2, action) {
    return state;
}

redux.createStore(
    appReducer,
    initialState2,
    redux.applyMiddleware(createMiddleware())
)
```

environment:
- redux: 3.7.2
- typescript: 2.6.2

so `applyMiddleware` should probably take generic parameter for state and pass it to the middlewares?
```typescript
// current definition
export function applyMiddleware(...middlewares: Middleware[]): GenericStoreEnhancer;

// should be probably defined something like:
export function applyMiddleware<S>(...middlewares: Middleware<S>[]): GenericStoreEnhancer;

JeffreyWay_laravel-mix,2308,Cannot change the HMR port easily for multiple projects running simultaneously,"-   Laravel Mix Version: 4.1.4 (`npm list --depth=0`)
-   Node Version (`node -v`): 11.15.0
-   NPM Version (`npm -v`): 6.7.0
-   OS: macOS Catalina (10.15.2)

### Description:

I think that HMR is not working as it should. If you run the script `npm run hot` without providing a port argument, it will bind 8080 port. It is good for a single project. A lot of times I have 3-5 projects at once, so `laravel-mix` is not good enough for my work, yet. I'm currently using my own gulp+webpack combination, but I think it would be much better to use something popular like `laravel-mix`, so let's see what's my problem.

### Steps To Reproduce:

1. Start multiple laravel projects at once
2. The first project can be run with `php artisan serve` and `npm run hot`
3. The second project can be run with `php artisan serve`, now he detects, that the port 8000 is occupied, os it bind 8001 - so far so good
4. Now you want to run HMR in the second project, but `npm run hot` won't work, because it just ""die"" when the port 8080 is occupied
5. Ok then, run `npm run hot -- --port=8081`, hooray - it works!
6. Hold on! Webpack output is still served from port 8080! And here we go.
7. Open server URLs in the browser and now you see - both have the same assets!

Here is the screenshot:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208491-8857f200-34a3-11ea-8989-9bb491a7ec36.png)

I have created 2 same laravel projects from scratch with a simple change in the app.scss - I have changed their body's background to see the effect:

When I look into the browser I see both projects having the same background:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208527-f3a1c400-34a3-11ea-8255-c7c0b94d76ce.png)

The reason is simple - both projects' webpack are served from the same host.

The solution is also theoretically simple, just add this into the `webpack.mix.js` file:
```
mix.options({
        hmrOptions: {
            host: 'localhost',
            port: '8081'
        },
    })...
```

Now I re-run the script for `test2` project and it seems to be working well, even both projects now have different backgrounds!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208594-a96d1280-34a4-11ea-99ac-6bef63226d02.png)

### But this is not a good solution.

Why? Well, because you are changing a JS file, which is also in the project's repository and used by other coworkers. We can change a port for every project we create, but it's still a solution just for a single team. If you want to work on something your own/private or even for a different team, a random HMR port can be set in both teams for different projects, and it will cause a problem. Maybe it's not a common problem, but when this will occur, there will be no fix.

### What is a good solution then?

**Option 1:** make it possible to change HMR port in run command, for example: `npm run hot -- --port=8081 --hmr-port=8081`, since every developer is running this command separately, so there is no change for other developers.

**Option 2:** check for the occupied port, if it is occupied, then add +1 and so on, until there is a free port, which will add developers much better UX when running HMR. Artisan's serve is a good example.

reduxjs_react-redux,671,No errors caught when a state change triggers re-render,"Basically what the title says. I'm using `react-redux` in my `react-native` app. I was having some problems with some bugs without any errors at all. After messing with the code I managed to find the cause for the problems I'm having:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';                                                                                  
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import DivisionAction from '../../actions/division';

class DivisionIndexView extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {showNumbers: false};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    const { dispatch } = this.props;
    dispatch(DivisionAction.requestDivisions());
  }

  _handlePress = () => {
    this.setState({showNumbers: !this.state.showNumbers});
  }

  render() {
    let nums = []; 
    // >>> CHECKPOINT 1
    if (this.state.showNumbers) nums = [1, 2, 3]; 
    const numbers = nums.map((n) =>
        // >>> CHECKPOINT 2
        <DoesnExists key={n}>{n}</DoesnExists>
    );  

    return (
      <View>
        <Button title=""Toggle numbers"" onPress={this._handlePress} />
        {numbers}
      </View>
    );  
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  // state.division reducer has a boolean `loaded` field.
  return state.division;
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(DivisionIndexView);
```

The previous code triggers an error when you press the button. Each time the button is pressed, state.showNumbers changes between `true` and `false`; when it is true, it makes the array `nums` (CHECKPOINT 1) equal to some elements which are then used to render the non-existing element `<DoesntExits>...</DoesnExists>` (CHECKPOINT 2).

The previous error is expected, however, if I change `this.state.showNumbers` at CHECKPOINT 1 to `this.props.loaded`, I get no errors at all, the element just doesn't render.

**I'm not sure** if this error is caused by `react-redux`, however, that seems to be the case. Maybe the way `react-redux` triggers a re-render is conflicting in some way?",https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/671,Not  a Bug,,
mafintosh_pumpify,7,"does pumpify not emit ""end"" when an error happens?","Given streams A, B, C are streams I have 
`const stream = pumpify.obj(A, B, C)`

if A emits `error` followed by an emit of `end`, the pumpified `stream` emits `error` but does not emit `end`. Is that the correct behavior? Does a pumpify pipeline close on an error only emitting an error event without emitting an end.  

Still trying to understand Node streams, but from what I got on normal Node streams an error does not stop the stream so there is also an end. I am writing some code that has to know when a pipeline finishes hence my confusion with `error` and `end`

Therefore to know if something finished successfully do I just listen to `end` and to know if something finished failing i listen to `error`.",https://github.com/mafintosh/pumpify/issues/7,Not  a Bug,,

Possibly this is something to do with very large sourcemaps.

Any help would be much appreciated.

and there is an examplanation on the Autoprefixer .
>No prefixes in production
Many other tools contain Autoprefixer. For example, webpack uses Autoprefixer to minify CSS by cleaning unnecessary prefixes.
If you set browsers list to Autoprefixer by browsers option, only first Autoprefixer will know your browsers. Autoprefixer inside webpack will use default browsers list. As result, webpack will remove prefixes, that first Autoprefixer added.
You need to put your browsers to browserslist config in project root — as result all tools (Autoprefixer, cssnano, doiuse, cssnext) will use same browsers list.

I also do that , but it also doesn't work..and the project directory like this
1. app
    *. assets
    *. components
    *. browserslist
  ...
2. dist

gaearon_react-hot-loader,749,[4.0.0-beta.7] Reloading in deep component leads to reloading the whole state (root component),"I have pretty big project with a lot of decorators. In v3 reloading in a deep and independent component leaded to reload only that component. Now if I reload `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` will be reloaded as well.
My rough code structure:

```
import {hot} from 'react-hot-loader';
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import {Provider, connect} from 'react-redux';
import {BrowserRouter, withRouter} from 'react-router-dom';

const HotApp = hot(module)(App);

const HotConnectedApp = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <HotApp/>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>
);

render(
  <HotConnectedApp/>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);

@withRouter
@connect(...)
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    initialFetchWasMade: false,
  };

  componentWillMount() {
    this.makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent();
  }
  
  makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent = () => {
    setTimeout(
      () => this.setState(() => ({initialFetchWasMade: true})),

  };
  
  render() {
    const {initialFetchWasMade} = this.state;

      <div>
        <Header/>
        <Footer/>
      </div>

  }
}
```

Now, if I make a change in `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` reloads and `makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent` is called every time (and it takes pretty long time sometimes). 
In v3 only `<Footer/>` was reloaded.

immerjs_immer,623,[Typescript] produce seems to loose reference / destructure original interface,"## 🐛 Bug Report
I'm not sure how to describe this bug, it's actually best shown in that codesandbox. But essentially in my example I am passing current state to `produce` and it correctly inherits its type, I then define my draft and for some reason that type changes into somewhat of an expanded object. This leads to type issues latter on as you will see from example where HTMLImageElement type is no longer valid as draft has an object type with all image element attributes.

## Link to repro
https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-drake-182z5?file=/src/index.tsx

You should see type error on line 16 where for some reason it no longer inherits type as `HTMLImageElement`, but rather makes it an object

## To Reproduce

```ts
import produce from ""immer"";

interface Store {
  uiImages: Record<string, HTMLImageElement>;
  setImage: () => void;
}

const store: Store = {
  uiImages: {},
  setImage() {
    produce(store, draft => {
      const image = new Image();
      draft.uiImages[""test""] = image; // Type Error Here
    });
  }
};
```

## Observed behavior

Overwrites type. In theory it keeps everything as is, but in strict mode types are no longer valid.

## Expected behavior

Should keep exactly same type?

```
[HMR] The following modules couldn't be hot updated: (Full reload needed)
This is usually because the modules which have changed (and their parents) do not know how to hot reload themselves. See http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html for more details.

reduxjs_react-redux,91,Using latest version of react-redux together with redux-devtools breaks,"**NOTE** [Also on redux-devtools repo](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/issues/96)

I have executed `ncu -u` to upgrade my package dependencies, to have the settlement like described below:

Previous versions:

``` json
{
  ""react-redux"": ""^0.2.2"",
  ""redux-devtools"": ""^0.1.2""
}
```

New versions:

``` json
{
  ""react-redux"": ""^2.1.0"",
  ""redux-devtools"": ""^2.1.0""
}
```

 And after installing newer package versions, saw an error displayed on console:

``` javascript
createConnect.js?70ef:76 Uncaught TypeError: store.getState is not a function
```

After searching for a while, I realised, by debugging the injected code by webpack, it had to do with the `devtools`.

Here the following code snippet:

``` javascript
import { devTools, persistState } from 'redux-devtools';
import { DevTools, DebugPanel, LogMonitor } from 'redux-devtools/lib/react';
/*** some other things ***/

const finalCreateStore = compose(
  devTools(),
  persistState(window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\b/)),
  createStore
);

/*** some other things ***/

<div className={nameBuilder(componentName, 'content')}>
  <Provider store={store}>
    {() => <Routing {...{history}}/> }
  </Provider>
  <DebugPanel top right bottom>
    <DevTools store={store} monitor={LogMonitor}/>
  </DebugPanel>
</div>
```

If I comment out exactly the imports as well as the `devTools(), persistState(...),`as well as the `<DebugPanel>...</DebugPanel>`, simply works.

The reason why isn't working. I don't know. I'm quite new on these technologies and haven't follow issues' discussions you have had around.

I can state then that by using the latest versions of react-redux together with the DebugPanel of redux-devtools, the application crashes not bootstrapping properly.

### Steps To Reproduce:

My `package.json` scripts are this:
```
""scripts"": {
    ""dev"": ""npm run development"",
    ""development"": ""cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js"",

    ""hot"": ""cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --inline --hot --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js"",
    ""prod"": ""npm run production"",
    ""production"": ""cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js""
  },
```
My `webpack.mix.js` is setup to use BrowserSync like so:
```
const BrowserSyncPlugin = require('browser-sync-webpack-plugin')

mix.webpackConfig({
    plugins: [
        new BrowserSyncPlugin(
            {
                files: [
                    './**/*.css',
                    'resources/views/**/*.php'
                ]
            },
            {
                reload: false,
                open: false
            }
        )
    ]
})
```
I tried running `watch` removing BrowserSync from the config, but I got the same problem.

One last thing, since I'm new at this and couldn't find any info anywhere, if I get `watch` to run can I open browser on my host machine to watch the changes or does it need to be on the VM?

2. run an http server in the root dir, and open the index.html in the browser on the http protocol
3. things work. There are no errors in the console in Chrome, and three errors in Firefox (due to it lacking support for something used in the variable otf fonts).
4. roll up Font.js using `rollup --format=esm Font.js > Font.rolled.js` and edit index.html to use this rolled up script instead.
5. Reload the browser

rollup_rollup,2195,Importing modules with try,"Hi,

I've just spent a good half hour trying to work out why my build didn't work.

Basically it comes down to three things:
1. an external module exposes a `try` variable
2. I have imported all (`*`) of that module's exports (and used the `try` variable)
3. I then want to uglify my bundle

Rollup doesn't appear to account for this reserved word (I haven't checked any others). Shouldn't this sort of thing be handled automatically?

reduxjs_redux,803,Duplicate actions with dispatching on componentWillReceiveProps and time-travel debugging,"In an application I work on, data is fetched in response to a store change, very similarly to how the `async` example works, and following the suggested pattern from issue #448. However, I've noticed with redux-devtools and time-travel debugging, there's an unfortunate consequence to this design. If you reverse actions and replay them, they can fire additional, unwanted actions that are appended to the end of the event stream. This leads to a messy event stream any time you replay actions that may cause a fetch async action.

This behavior can be reproduced by adding redux-devtools to the async example. You'll see if you revert and replay the actions, that the `fetchPostsIfNeeded` action will be called again [here](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/master/examples/async/containers/App.js#L22). This will append a new action to the end of the action stream.

reduxjs_redux,2435,compose not working while __REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ works,"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**  
bug
(If this is a *usage question*, please **do not post it here**—post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux) instead. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.)



**What is the current behavior?**
Some enhancers like `autoRehydrate` from `redux-persist` doesn't work when using `compose` from redux in production mode, while using `window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__` in the same environment works.


**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**
Using `react-boilerplate`, add `redux-persist@4.8.0` and `redux-action-buffer@1.1.0`. 
Then, this is the store configuration code:
```javascript
  const middlewares = [
    sagaMiddleware,
    routerMiddleware(history),
    createActionBuffer(REHYDRATE),
  ];

  const enhancers = [
    autoRehydrate(),
    applyMiddleware(...middlewares),
  ];

  // If Redux DevTools Extension is installed use it, otherwise use Redux compose
  /* eslint-disable no-underscore-dangle */
  const composeEnhancers =
    process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' &&
    typeof window === 'object' &&
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ ?
      window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ : compose;
  /* eslint-enable */

  const store = createStore(
    createReducer(),
    initialState,
    composeEnhancers(...enhancers),
  );
```
Build the package with `NODE_ENV=production`. Rehydration won't work, but if we omit the condition to use `window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__` instead, it works well.

**What is the expected behavior?**
All enhancers and middleware work. In this case, rehydration of the state.

webpack-contrib_uglifyjs-webpack-plugin,30,Identifiers in JSX attributes not being uglified,"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

bug

**What is the current behavior?**

Uglify fails to process some identifiers.

I recently upgraded a React/Redux/TypeScript project from TypeScript 2.2 + Babel + Webpack 2.2 to TypeScript 2.3.2 + Webpack 2.5.1. This project makes heavy use of Immutable and i18next.

After the uglify process, my client.js bundle had exactly one reference to i18next_1.t and immutable_1.fromJS, which is odd because I use both all over the app. Both of these caused errors in the browser because i18next and immutable were undefined (the real ones had been uglified).

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

The two instances shared a few attributes:
- they were both referenced from within a JSX attribute
- they were both from a stateless React component

e.g. UglifyJSPlugin fails on this code (note that TypeScript changes the ""t"" in placeholder to be i18next_1.t)
```ts
import { t } from 'i18next';

export const TitleField = ({ input }: any) =>
    <input id=""title"" maxLength={ 32 } type=""text"" { ...input } placeholder={ t(""TITLE_PLACEHOLDER"") } autoFocus={ true }/>
;
```

However, it worked when I rewrote the component to have the function call outside of the JSX attribute:
```ts
import { t } from 'i18next';

export const TitleField = ({ input }: any) => {
    const placeholder = t(""TITLE_PLACEHOLDER"");
    return (
        <input id=""title"" maxLength={ 32 } type=""text"" { ...input } placeholder={ placeholder } autoFocus={ true }/>
    );
};
```

**What is the expected behavior?**

Identifier should be uglified

**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior?**

n/a

reduxjs_redux,3760,Fetching from Reddit API in advanced tutorial fails with CORS error in console on firefox (with strict enhanced tracking protection enabled),"## What docs page needs to be fixed?

- **Section**: https://redux.js.org/advanced
- **Page**: https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions

## What is the problem?
When running Firefox (75.0) in ""strict"" (or certain configurations of custom) ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" mode, calls toward the Reddit API fails with the following error in the console:

> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs.json. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).

This was confusing, as I initially thought this was due to something I had done wrong in the tutorial.

After investigating some more, I started thinking it was an issue with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header from the API as the exact same fetch code worked with https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

However the tutorial code _did_ work on chrome, which made the issue all the more confusing. I ended up finding someone else that had the same issue on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/di9y1t/reddit_api_calls_being_blocked_by_firefox_content/f3ua0ax/), which led me to test the ""Standard"" Enhanced Tracking Protection mode which made the tutorial code that I had written initially, work.

## What should be changed to fix the problem?
One solution could be to switch to some API in the example that is not considered a tracker by Firefox (or any other browser).

I also wanted to add this issue for posterity, so that if anyone else stumbles over the same issue, they won't have to waste as much time as I did with trying to find the root cause.",https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3760,Not  a Bug,NOTHING THE maintainers can do ,

JeffreyWay_laravel-mix,64,{{ mix }} function should take devServer.host into account when running HMR,"My current setup is a Homestead VM running the Laravel Mix Example on my Mac. 

When i _npm run hmr_ the node.js server is started on localhost, which i cannot access outside the VM. 

Adding _host: ""laravel-mix.app""_ within webpack.config.js i get the following output:

`Project is running at http://laravel-mix.app:8080/`
`webpack output is served from http://localhost:8080/`
`404s will fallback to /index.html`

I've added port 8080 to my Homestead ports, and can now access the node server from my local machine. 

When using the mix() function in a blade template, the localhost:8080 is hardcoded into the asset path, and not pulled from the webpack config file, thus making the loading of assets fail when accessing the site in my local browser.

reduxjs_react-redux,1332,Rendering connected component with undefined 'mergedProps' parameter throws TSLint error 2739,"I ran into an issue using React Redux together with TypeScript and TSLint.

I added the option parameter to the connect function for my component, having to put a nullified parameter for mergeProps in between.

```
export default connect<PropsFromState, PropsFromDispatch, OwnProps>(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps,
    null,
    { forwardRef : true }
)(MyComponent);
```

**What is the current behavior?**

Wanting to render the component throws a TSLint error for me:

`<MyComponent ownProp ref={ref => this.comp = ref}/>`

> Type '{ ownProp: true; ref: (ref: Component<Pick<MyComponent, ""ownProp"" | ""stateProp"" | ""dispatchProp""> & OwnProps, any, any>) => Component<...>; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Readonly<Pick<MyComponentProps, ""ownProp"" | ""stateProp"" | ""dispatchProp""> & OwnProps>': stateProp, dispatchProp - ts(2739)

...basically asking for state and dispatch props where it shouldn't ask for them.

Tracing back the type definition of connect (via Visual Studio Code), it refers me to

```
<TStateProps = {}, TDispatchProps = {}, TOwnProps = {}, TMergedProps = {}, State = {}>(
	mapStateToProps: MapStateToPropsParam<TStateProps, TOwnProps, State>,
	mapDispatchToProps: MapDispatchToPropsParam<TDispatchProps, TOwnProps>,
	mergeProps: MergeProps<TStateProps, TDispatchProps, TOwnProps, TMergedProps>,
	options?: Options<State, TStateProps, TOwnProps, TMergedProps>
): InferableComponentEnhancerWithProps<TMergedProps, TOwnProps>;
```

**What is the expected behavior?**

The component should render without any issues, not asking for state and dispatch props.

The type definition of connect should actually refer to

```
<TStateProps = {}, TDispatchProps = {}, TOwnProps = {}, State = {}>(
	mapStateToProps: MapStateToPropsParam<TStateProps, TOwnProps, State>,
	mapDispatchToProps: MapDispatchToPropsNonObject<TDispatchProps, TOwnProps>,

csstree_csstree,96,[question] List.remove(),"Hey @lahmatiy ,

I'm trying to use `csstree` and `node-html-parser` to remove unused rules from a stylesheet.

What i have is to invoke `querySelector` on the parsed html structure and determine if there are any matches for any selector. If not, i can safely remove the selector form a `SelectorList`, and if the selector list becomes empty, i can remove the entire block. It seems like something that should be pretty easy but i'm finding the AST structure a bit too granular. For instance i need to split the selectors only on the `,` combinator but not have to reconstruct the rest of the selectors from the AST.

Ideally, given this:

```css
#list > #foo,
.x y {
  color: white;
}
```

i can get back `#list > #foo` and `.x y` and remove either one, or both, and also the entire block (if both). in my futile attempts, removing just `#list` from `#list, .abc`, for instance, still leaves me with the `, .abc` when i run `csstree.generate(ast)`.

benmosher_eslint-plugin-import,867,Possible bug or need to improve documentation,"After looking at the documentation for the import/no-named-as-default eslint rule, I'm still confused about what exactly I'm doing wrong.

I have the following file structure

    .
    ├── ButtonBack.css
    ├── ButtonBack.jsx
    ├── __tests__
    │   └── ButtonBack.test.jsx
    └── index.js

The ButtonBack.jsx contains the following code

    import React from 'react';
    import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
    
    export default class ButtonBack extends React.Component {
      ... code removed to keep example short ...
    }

\__tests__/ButtonBack.test.jsx contains the following code

    import React from 'react';
    import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
    import ButtonBack from '../ButtonBack'; // <== this line has an eslint warning

    ... code removed to keep example short ...

The problem is, my linter says that ```import ButtonBack from '../ButtonBack``` violates the following lint rules:

 - [import/no-named-as-default][1]
 - [import/no-named-as-default-member][2]

    
I can't figure out why my import statement violates the lint rule.  
- Removing the name of the class in ButtonBack.jsx (```export default class extends React.Component```) does not solve the issue.
- there is only one export in ButtonBack.jsx

reduxjs_redux,1634,Problem in recursive Component of SPA,"We can assume that: we have a SPA application consist of a `profile` page and a `followerList` page. The state tree is as shown in the following:

```
{
  profile: { name: xx, sex: xx },
  followerList: []

```

We can open a follower list page from a profile **page A**, and then open a profile **page B** from the follower list page. In my application, page A and page B share the same reducer `profile`.

Here is the problem: when page B rendered, the `profile` in state tree has been changed by B's info; when it returns back to page A, it is supposed to keep A's info, **but it has also been rendered by B's info**.

---

So far I've got two solutions:
1. Using a `profileList` to keep all profile pages have been opened. It means that I have to keep a list for every page which can be opened recursively.
2. Re-rendering the profile page when the page is returned. I don't think it's an elegant way.

webpack-contrib_uglifyjs-webpack-plugin,328,Unable to add a reserved word to mangle,"Hi,

I am experiencing an issue with `webpack 4.14` + `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin 1.2.7` + `uglify-es 3.3.9`: I am unable to add a reserved class name to mangle in webpack production mode to prevent the minifier from renaming it...

When compressing my bundle in **production mode**, uglifyjs-webpack-plugin is renaming the `Smooth` class name of the external package. Setting a reserved word does not seems to fix the problem.

Here is a preview of my `webpack.prod.js` configuration file:

```
const path = require('path');
const uglify = require('uglifyjs-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: './javascript/src/script.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'app.min.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'javascript')
  },
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new uglify({
        parallel: true,
        uglifyOptions: {
          output: {
            comments: false
          },
          mangle: {
            reserved: ['Smooth']
          }
        }
      })
    ]
  }
};
```

And here is a link to a **test repository** where the issue happen: https://github.com/xavierfoucrier/webpack-uglify-es-mangle.

The problem is that `new Smooth(...)` is transformed into `new v(...)` in the minified version.

I tried a lot of things in the configuration: compress options, mangle options, etc.. nothing works.

Thanks for your help.

  3. Provide a minimal repository link (Read https://git.io/fNzHA for instructions).
     These may take more time to triage than the other options.
-->

Three ways  to reproduce:

Bug #1. Following the tutorial from https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#tutorial create these files

main.js

```
import foo from './foo.js';
export default function () {
  console.log(foo);
}

```
foo.js
`export default 'hello world!';`

rollup.config.js
```
export default {
  input: 'src/main.js',
  output: {
    file: 'bundle.js',
    format: 'esm'
  }
};

```
~    

run command `rollup -c`

Bug #2. Repeat steps in bug #1 (rollup.config.js not necessary) but  run` rollup src/main.js -f esm` instead.



Bug #3. Follow all the standard steps in the tutorial all the way up to code splitting   part https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#code-splitting where you enter rollup src/main.js src/main2.js -f esm -d dist            

### Expected Behavior

Bug #1: running rollup -c should output bundle.js in esm.
 
Bug #2: running rollup src/main.js -f esm should output in esm.

Bug #3 following tutorial up to code splitting when running  `rollup src/main.js src/main2.js -f esm -d dist` should output code splitting in ESM like this

```
<!doctype html>
<script type=""module"">
  import main2 from './dist/main2.js';
  main2();
</script>
```



### Actual Behavior

Bug #1 bundle.js outputs in commonJS like this.

```
var foo = 'hello world!';

Bug #2  outputs to stdout is in commonJS like this: 

 ```
   src/main.js → stdout...
var foo = 'hello world!';

function main () {
  console.log(foo);
}
```

Bug #3: Dist folder shows 

dist/main.js 
```
 function main () {
  import('./foo-5e0078b9.js').then(({ default: foo }) => console.log(foo));
}

export default main;
             
```
dist/main2.js
```

import foo from './foo-5e0078b9.js';

function main2 () {
  console.log(foo);
}

export default main2;
```

chunked foo.js file: 

```
var foo = 'hello world!';

export default foo;
```

benmosher_eslint-plugin-import,518,import/namespace does not support shadowing,"`import/namespace` does not detect when something in a closer scope shadows a namespace import, leading to bogus lint warnings.

JeffreyWay_laravel-mix,1850,Laravel-Mix 4.0.2 breaks /deep/ in Vue component styling,"<!--
    Before posting this issue, please perform the following steps, and confirm that the issue is still present.

1. Update Laravel Mix to the latest version. (`npm update laravel-mix` or `yarn upgrade laravel-mix --latest`)
2. Nuke your dependencies, and reinstall from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
3. Check your `package.json` file, and ensure that there are no old Laravel Elixir dependencies that might be interfering with Mix.
-->

-   Laravel Mix Version: 4.0.2 (`npm list --depth=0`)
-   Node Version (`node -v`): 11.3
-   NPM Version (`npm -v`): 6.5
-   OS: MacOS Mojave

### Description:
I have a Vue component where I need scoped styling to affect a child component.[ I use ```/deep/``` for this.](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html#child-component-root-elements) This has always worked pre Laravel-Mix 4.
```html
<style lang=""scss"" scoped>
    /deep/ .some-styling {
    }
```

With Laravel-Mix 4, I get the following error on ```npm run dev```:
```
         }
     ^
      Expected selector.
    & /deep/ .some-foo-styling{
      ^
```
or 
```
    .some-other-styling {
^
      Expected selector.
/deep/.some-styling{
^

```
It seems clear that Mix no longer understands what ```/deep/``` is, so I tried replacing it with the thing that it's an alias for: ```>>>```

Mix now compiles without error, but sadly the generated CSS is wrong.
It should be:
```CSS
[data-v-507877ae] .some-styling {
}
```
but instead it generates:
```CSS
 > .some-styling[data-v-507877ae] {
}
```
which means that the class must now be a direct descendant, so my styling breaks.",https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/1850,Intrinsic,,

chimurai_http-proxy-middleware,290,404 errror instead of 302 response,"### Expected behavior

Correctly forward server response, when server responds with 302 Moved Temporarily

### Actual behavior

Finalhandler created error response 404 Not Found ""Cannot PATCH /externaj/path/to/api/other/resource"". The original response is swallowed.

### Setup

* http-proxy-middleware: 0.18.0
* server: webpack-dev-server

#### proxy middleware configuration
```javascript
var apiProxy = proxy('/api', {
  target: 'http://localhost',
  pathRewrite: {

  },
});
```

#### server mounting
```javascript
var app = express();

app.use(apiProxy);
app.listen(3000);

### Workaround

rewriting the response leads to the desired result

gaearon_react-hot-loader,442,ShouldComponentUpdate bypassed when rendered from root,"### Description

There is a bug where shouldComponentUpdate is not being called. In our case it caused bugs to be discovered only in production mode, since the app was rendered on every small change in development mode. This is also a performance hit (which is important is development too).

### Expected behavior
shouldComponentUpdate should be raised before every render

### Actual behavior
shouldComponentUpdate is not being raised

### Environment
React Hot Loader version: 3.0.0-beta.X
1. `node -v`: v6.3.1
2. `npm -v`: 3.10.5

We have an app where on state changes we re-render from the top. On every render we would expect shouldComponentUpdate to be called, but it is not. Other lifecycle hooks we checked, are being raised as expected. We have reproduced it on the react-hot-boilerplate (see below).

1. Operating system: Windows 7
2. Browser and version: Chrome 54.0.2840.99 m (64-bit)

prettier_prettier,2067,Respect line breaks around directives,"prettier does a great job of respecting line breaks (for separating ideas).  Unfortunately it always removes line breaks after directives.  Is this part of the opinionated-ness of prettier?

axios_axios,2296,Could not find a declaration file for module 'axios/lib/adapters/http',"**Describe the bug**
Importing the axios **HttpAdapter** in a unit test fails.

**To Reproduce**
Create a simple test file containing this at the start:
```
import axios from 'axios';
import httpAdapter from 'axios/lib/adapters/http';
import nock from 'nock';

axios.defaults.url = 'https://localhost';
axios.defaults.adapter = httpAdapter;
...
```
This produces the following error:
```
TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'axios/lib/adapters/http'. 'C:/Users/<user>/<project>/node_modules/axios/lib/adapters/http.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm install @types/axios` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'axios';`
```

**Expected behavior**
I expected the import to work. I found a stackoverflow question related to this here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50954167/how-to-add-type-definitions-for-module-in-subdirectory

Following this I created `src/types/axios.d.ts` with the following contents:
```
declare module 'axios/lib/adapters/http' {
  import { Adapter } from 'axios';

  const HttpAdapter: Adapter;

  export default HttpAdapter;
}
```
and this seems to fix the issue but I consider it a workaround and it would be nice to have axios contain Typescript type definitions for all the types it defines.

**Environment:**
 - Axios Version [0.19.0]
 - OS: [OSX 10.14.5 (18F203)]
 - Browser [N/A]

The issue occurs within the 'UPDATE_ENGAGEMENT' case -- the actual business logic has been removed and replaced with the simplest example to demonstrate the problem. 

When a new array created from state via state.slice() is returned, a loop is triggered, causing the action to be dispatched until an 'Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded' error is raised. Below is a screenshot of the browser console during the issue's occurrence.

I have a strange issue that I've been trying to fix for about a week without any luck...

When I post to my API the int and datetime values are posted as null, which results in the API returning a 400 response.

Here's an example of the code:
```
        axios
            .post('http://localhost:5000/v1/resources/listings/', {
              category_id: 1,

              location: this.location,
              description: this.description,
              price: this.price,
              is_available: this.is_available,
              available_from: this.available_from,
              available_until: this.available_until
            })
            .then(response => {
              this.$router.push('/users/profile')
            })
            .catch(function(error) {
              // Show server response if the request doesn't return a HTTP 201 status code.
              self.$toast.open({
                message: error.response.data.error,

                position: 'is-bottom'
              })
            })
```
In the above code I even hard coded the category_id but the response I get is still the same:
```

gaearon_react-hot-loader,527,Actions dispatched again when reducers are hot reloaded,"### Description
This is a question. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or it's intended behavior.
What you are reporting:
I'm trying react hot reloading, along with reducers. It's working perfectly, although I'm not sure about reducers.

Let's say I've this reducer:
```JavaScript
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return {
        count: state.count + 2
      };

    case DECREMENT:
      return {
        count: ((state.count - 1 > 0) ? state.count - 1 : 0)
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
```
I dispatched `INCREMENT` 3 times, and my UI shows ""6""
I change `INCREMENT` case and save `count:state.count + 1`

### Expected behavior
Hot reloaded, UI should still show 6, but when I dispatch `INCREMENT` again, it should become 7

### Actual behavior
Hot reloaded, UI shows 3 (actions are dispatched again), and when I dispatch `INCREMENT` it does become 4.

It does work, but replays actions again. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

I'm working on a project with IE11 support and Axios. As I also need some advanced URLSearchParams support, so I'm using [@ungap/url-search-params](https://github.com/ungap/url-search-params) to implement it.

**To Reproduce**
I couldn't try out the code in IE11 because runkit doesn't work in IE, but this should be able to reproduce the error.

In both cases, the state is preserved during HMR when I change the template portion, but not when I change the script portion of the `*.vue` file.

To reproduce: 
- modify `src/components/Hello.vue` of the vue-cli created example:

``` html
<template>
  <div id=""hello"">
    <h1>{{ count }}</h1>
    <button v-on:click='inc'>inc</button>
    <button v-on:click='count -= 1'>dec</button>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'hello',
  data () { return { count: 1 } },
  methods: { inc: function() { this.count += 1} }
}
</script>
```
- run the example with `npm run dev`
- press 'inc' a few times to change the state
- change `count -= 1` to `count -= 2` in the template part
  - after HMR, the counter value is preserved
- change `count += 1` to `count += 2` in the script part
  - after HMR, the counter value is reset to 1

gaearon_react-hot-loader,1181,hot update failed for module even though it works (RHL + Fable),"### Description
I am trying to get RHL working with Fable (an F# to JavaScript compiler), and I am very close, but it seems there is still some issue causing an error message to appear.

Fable uses it's own webpack loader (and relies on Babel), and the original issue can be seen here: https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/issues/1733

The original issue was that `fable-loader` did not set `babelOptions.filename` which RHL seems to need. This can be remedied by adding the option in `fable-loader` (this has not been updated in the main line yet, but I have just been patching node_modules for now while trying to get to the bottom of this).

Now that the original issue is gone, RHL seems to be working 100% (I can change code and it hot-reloads successfully, all while maintaining react component state).
However, when a hot-update occurs, RHL still reports an error:
![Image of Yaktocat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12754240/52811139-99a93c00-3051-11e9-969e-de049c273e63.png)

It seems that something is still tripping RHL up, but I can't seem to figure out what. I've looked at the code that is generated into the bundle, that is throwing the error, but I am not familiar enough with the internals of HMR to figure out what could be causing it...
This is the function that throws the error (after a timeout of 100ms)...
```
var chargeFailbackTimer = function chargeFailbackTimer(id) {
  return setTimeout(function () {
    var error = 'hot update failed for module ""' + id + '"". Last file processed: ""' + getLastModuleOpened() + '"".';
    logger.error(error);
    logException({
      toString: function toString() {
        return error;
      }
    });
    // 100 ms more ""code"" tolerant that 0, and would catch error in any case
  }, 100);
};
```
and it is called later...
```
var failbackTimer = chargeFailbackTimer(sourceModule.id);
  var firstHotRegistered = false;

  // TODO: Ensure that all exports from this file are react components.

  return function (WrappedComponent, props) {
    clearFailbackTimer(failbackTimer);
    // register proxy for wrapped component
    // only one hot per file would use this registration
    if (!firstHotRegistered) {
      firstHotRegistered = true;
      reactHotLoader.register(WrappedComponent, getComponentDisplayName(WrappedComponent), 'RHL' + moduleId);
    }
...
```
It looks like it is thrown after 100ms unless the other call to `clearFailbackTimer` cancels it... so maybe something is too slow?

Any ideas what could be tripping up RHL in this case? It's strange that RHL is working, but still ends up throwing this error. Any insight would be appreciated 😁 

### Environment

React Hot Loader version: 4.6.5

Run these commands in the project folder and fill in their results:
1.  `node -v`: 11.4.0
2.  `npm -v`: 6.4.1
3. `yarn -v`: 1.12.3

Then, specify:

1.  Operating system: Windows 10 x64
2.  Browser and version: Chrome (Version 72.0.3626.109 (Official Build) (64-bit))

### Reproducible Demo

Download the demo ([RHL_Fable.zip](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/files/2866866/RHL_Fable.zip)), and then run `yarn` (or `npm install`).
Before running `yarn start`, you must edit the file at `node_modules/fable-loader/index.js`.
Look for the `transformBabelAst` function and add the line:
`babelOptions.filename = sourceMapOptions.path.replace(/\\/g, '/');`
between
`babelOptions.sourceMaps = true;`
and
`babelOptions.sourceFileName = path.relative(process.cwd(), sourceMapOptions.path.replace(/\\/g, '/'));`
Save the file and then run `yarn start`.

So as far as I could tell, there aren't any issues for this specific case in this or the [rollup plugin repo](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-replace). The standard way to inject process.env variables using rollup is to use the replace plugin. This rolls through your code and replaces strings that exactly match what you specify. This means if prettier turns `process.env.VAR` into `process.env.\nVAR`, then that environment variable is never replaced, and you get ""process is not defined"" or whatever other runtime error. I haven't run into this with the webpack.DefinePlugin, but I assume it works the same way, and would break as well.

So I'm not sure if this even needs to get fixed in this repo, or if maybe the plugins need to account for whitespace/be smarter in general about how they inject, but it's defintely an issue, and I figured this was the best place to start a discussion.

gaearon_react-hot-loader,1318,HMR is refreshing the entire component tree on any change.,"### Description

after updating to `4.12.10` and using `""react-dom"": ""npm:@hot-loader/react-dom"",`  any change in the components no matter how deeply nested. hmr will refresh the entire component tree. it should only update the change which caused it. 



### Expected behavior
HMR should only update the piece of code which was changed. or view which was updated. 


### Actual behavior
HMR refreshes entire component tree on every change made to any component in that tree. even if its a small change in one character in view. it refreshes the whole component tree.

```
main.js:164839 [HMR] Updated modules:
main.js:164839 [HMR]  - ./packages/applications/doctors-dashboard/src/App/Modules/EventsPage/EventsPage.component.jsx

changes like `hello world` to `hello worl` will trigger entire tree refresh.

I believe it is pretty straightforward, right? I dispatch `REQ_USER_INIT` and then REQ_USER_DATA once the response is received. I should log two actions, however I get 3.

socketio_engine.io-parser,60,Badly handle ArrayBuffer type,"This issue is originated from nwjs/nw.js#5034. When using Socket.io in latest NW.js, binary data cannot be handles properly.

The root cause is that engine.io-parser doesn't handle `ArrayBuffer` properly. See [lib/index.js:L148-L157](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-parser/blob/master/lib/index.js#L148-L157).

``` javascript
  if (binaryType === 'arraybuffer') { // <-- [1]
    var type = data[0]; // <-- [2]
    var intArray = new Uint8Array(data.length - 1);
    for (var i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
      intArray[i - 1] = data[i];
    }
    return { type: packetslist[type], data: intArray.buffer };
  }
  var type = data[0]; // <-- [3] 
  return { type: packetslist[type], data: data.slice(1) };
```
1. In Node.js or NW.js, `binaryType` is always `null`. I assume it's a bug as well.
2. `ArrayBuffer` cannot be directly read using array styled syntax `data[0]`. One should construct a TypedArray form the buffer, such as `Uint8Array`, and read the data inside.
3. I guess here it assumes `data` could only be a Node `Buffer`. However, in NW.js `data` can be of type `ArrayBuffer` from browser builtin `WebSocket`.",https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-parser/issues/60,Intrinsic,,
axios_axios,1913,Invalid URL is throwing an error that is circular JSON,"#### Summary

I am working through an issue with making an axios call to an invalid URL. A simple mistake I made in my URL is that when importing I was accidentally importing an object as the URL and so the request URL looked something like this ""[object]/blog"" which is an invalid URL. The error that was thrown by axios had circular JSON and so I was getting a very unhelpful error thrown by express that it could not parse circular JSON. Axios should throw errors that are natively able to be stringified from JSON so that I can stringify the error. PR #1625 looked to have fixed this issue however it looks like the same issue is occurring that it was looking to fix.

I narrowed down the failure to version 2.2.1 working and 2.3.0 causing the failure.

Here's a very simplified version of my HOC.  This is in a file by itself.

``` 
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

export default function HigherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent) {
  class Wrapper extends React.Component {
    static propTypes = {
      children: PropTypes.oneOfType([
        PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.node),
        PropTypes.node,
      ]).isRequired,

    componentDidMount() {
      // this.doStuff()
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <WrappedComponent
          {...this.props}
          wrapped={'Hey, I am a prop from the HOC!'}
        >{this.props.children}</WrappedComponent>);
    }
  }

  return Wrapper;
}
```

For some reason, PropTypes is ""undefined"".  However, if I change every instance of `PropTypes` to `React.PropTypes`, it works just fine because it is accessing the PropTypes object from React.

It could be something related to babel / rollup, but I'm not sure.  But I am suspicious of the issue being in Babel or Rollup because React gets passed through just fine.

Here is my .babelrc file:

```
{
  ""presets"": [""es2015-rollup"", ""react""],
  ""plugins"": [
    ""transform-class-properties""
  ]
}

Checklist:
- 'prop-types' is listed in my package.json under ""dependencies""
- I deleted my node_modules folder and ran `npm i`
- `import PropTypes from  'prop-types';` in other files seems to work just fine.  I think it has to do with PropTypes being used in a function?

reduxjs_redux,935,Redux version 3.0.3 and manually combining reducers doesn't trigger an update,"Version `3.0.2` works perfect with the following code, but breaks in version `3.0.3`. The following reducer is imported by another file and combined using `combineReducers()`. I'm assuming this has something to do with manually setting nested state properties instead of using `combineReducers()` in this file.

The specific issue comes from the `state.gallery` object not being represented with updated data.

I'm assuming that it has todo with the reference check that redux does when determining if `combineReducers()` should return the same object. Would this be because we are mutating the object?

axios_axios,2596,Axios error: Uncaught (in promise) Error: Request failed with status code 404,"#2508 ## Summary
I apologize in advance if that is not proper place to post my issue. At first I'd like to say I am a big fan of Axios. Now I'm having trouble with receiving Axios request on the Node server. I have seen similar problem posted for Apache server but there wasn't solution described. In my case server is Windows server 2016 IIS.

While requests sent to the server located on the same machine / localhost work perfectly, same request sent via Internet to the same machine but connected as remote server fails with above error. I heard somewhere that maybe it's about need for different approach in formatting URL in Axios. I tweaked server for days and every time I get same message. I cannot find out why this error involves 404 code if all routes work properly on localhost. On the Internet I found several peole with similar problems but no solution were mentioned.

Thanks

axios_axios,1981,httpsAgent does not work in combination with an HTTP-proxy.,"#### Description
I try to setup HTTPS-session using Axios which works fine through Fiddler.
This fails by the way on the current stable release [v0.18.0](https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.18.0), I guess this is issue #925, fixed in #959.

As soon as I remove Fiddle, it no longer works. I suspect that it is, because the connection is pooled by Fiddler. So in order to make it work without the Fiddler proxy, I inject httpsAgent to keep the connection alive e.g.:
```JavaScript
import * as http from 'https';
import * as https from 'https';

const Fiddler = {
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 8888
};

this.axios = Axios.create({
   proxy: Fiddler
   httpAgent: new http.Agent({keepAlive: true}),
   httpsAgent: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true, rejectUnauthorized: false})
````

I can't get it work with the https-agent assigned, not with a proxy:

expressjs_cookie-parser,48,cookieParser.signedCookie seems to not work properly,"Hello everyone. I'm trying to ""decode"" a signed cookie I receive in a websocket session. First, here is how I setup my express session with cookie-parser:

**static.ts** file
```
import * as cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import * as express from 'express';
import * as session from 'express-session';

const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser('foobarbaz1234567foobarbaz1234567'));
app.use(session({
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 600000, // 3600000 for 1 hour & 600000 for 10 minutes
    secure: process.env.VSCodeDebug && process.env.VSCodeDebug === 'true' ? false : true,
  },
  genid: () => genuuid(),
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  secret: 'foobarbaz1234567foobarbaz1234567',
  store: mystore,
}));
```

Somewhere in my code, when I receive a websocket connection, I'm able to get the signed cookie. But I want to decode it in order to have the session ID stored inside.

This is what I'm trying to do:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15614466/52139942-775dfa00-261f-11e9-9a86-b2fb45d6d49f.png)

As you can see, i'm using the same secret password with ""signedCookie"" than in the cookieParser initialization. The result of signedCookie returns everytime the same string as the signed cookie (temp3 value in my current example). And according to your documentation:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15614466/52140074-d885cd80-261f-11e9-99fc-b7e16aeeb3b6.png)
it kinda says that the signature is invalid or something like that. Is it possible that I'm missing something in my approch ? In my database where the cookie is stored, I can see the decoded cookie (i.e the session ID). So I guess that something looks wrong with ""signedCookie"" function (or maybe with my approch).

You can see bellow what I have in my request parameter.
Also, bellow, you can see what I observe when I'm trying to user signedCookie function. The output of this function is the same as the input (signedSession). And the secret is the same as in the cookie-parser configuration.

Here is what I have in my **webSocketSingleton.ts** file
`import * as cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';`

axios_axios,2107,Axios added duplicated content-length header when request already has a content-length header,"**Describe the bug**
Axios is a promise based HTTP client with browser and Node.js support. As an HTTP client, Axios wants to make sure the sent message contains a proper content-length header as well. So it includes a number type “Content-Length” header by default. This behavior can be observed in /node_modules/axios/lib/adapters/http.js, at line 45.
 
If request already has a lowercase ""content-length"" header, since they have different casing, the header included by Axios does not overwrite the one included by the request. So we’re sending two “content-length” headers to the server (same values and different types). I believe this is not the expected behavior we want.

**Expected behavior**

Before set content-length header, Axios should check if there is a case insensitive ""content-length"" header.

IF THERE IS AN EXISTING CONTENT-LENGTH HEADER:
  COMPARE WITH CONTENT-LENGTH CALCULATED
  IF DISMATCH
    THROW ERROR
ELSE
  SET CONTENT-LENGTH HEADER IN AXIOS

immerjs_immer,650,Error when working with immutable arrays with modified slice() method (`seamless-immutable`),"## 🐛 Bug Report

First of all, thanks for the great tool! I'm working on a large project that has previously used [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) for managing the Redux state. I would like to use `immer` for new code but it seems that `immer` fails when it tries to shallow-copy an array with an overridden `slice()`. The overridden `slice()` produces a new readonly array which is not what `immer` expects.

I would suggest a harmless fix: use `Array.prototype.slice(base)` or `[...base]` instead of `base.slice()` in the `shallowCopy()` method. I think many would benefit from this kind of compatibility. Will be happy to make a PR.

## Link to repro

https://codesandbox.io/s/immer-sandbox-j7ke0

## To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior: see the error in the sandbox when used in combination with `seamless-immutable`.

## Observed behavior

An error: `""Cannot assign to read only property '0' of object '[object Array]'""`

## Expected behavior

Producing a result as designed.

## Environment

axios_axios,1252,Strange behavior when header name matches HTTP request method,"#### Summary

Axios appears to treat headers names that correspond to lowercase HTTP methods incorrectly.

If the header name matches the current HTTP method, the header name is transformed to `0`:

```js
axios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'post': 'test'}});
```

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
0: test
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Get: test
User-Agent: axios/0.17.1
Host: localhost:8888
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

If the header name matches a different HTTP method, it is removed:

```js
axios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'get': 'test'}});
```

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: axios/0.17.1
Host: localhost:8888
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

This only seems to happen when the header name is lowercase-a header named `Get` is handled correctly:

```
axios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'Get': 'test'}});
```

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Get: test
User-Agent: axios/0.17.1
Host: localhost:8888
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

I didn't see anything in the docs about special meaning for these header names when passed directly. `axios.defaults.headers` has keys that correspond to HTTP methods, but it doesn't seem to make sense to interpret the headers set directly in the same way.

reduxjs_redux,3426,applyMiddleware type does not allow heterogeneously-typed middleware,"**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

Report a bug.

**What is the current behavior?**

Consider the following TypeScript program, minimized from a production use case:

```ts
import {Middleware, Reducer, applyMiddleware, createStore} from ""redux"";

type A = { a: string }
type B = { b: string }

const middlewareA: Middleware<{}, A> = (store) => (next) => (action) => next(action);
const middlewareB: Middleware<{}, B> = (store) => (next) => (action) => next(action);

const reducer: Reducer<A & B> = (state) => state;

createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(middlewareA, middlewareB));
```

In practice `middlewareA` and `middlewareB` deal with two separate domains and are defined in separate modules. They declare themselves as receiving only the state they know about.

I should be able to use both middleware simultaneously in a larger program whose aggregate state extends `A & B`, as shown. However, this produces a type error:

```
index.ts:11:51 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'Middleware<{}, B, Dispatch<AnyAction>>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Middleware<{}, A, any>'.
  Property 'a' is missing in type 'B' but required in type 'A'.

11 createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(middlewareA, middlewareB));
                                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~

    'a' is declared here.

```

**Which versions of Redux?**

Yes. The following works in 3.7.2:

const middlewareA: Middleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => next(action);

### What is expected?
* Success resolve loader

### What is actually happening?
* due options contains '!'
* vue-i18n-loader?{""extend"":{""en"":{""test"":""demo!""}}} has split into **vue-i18n-loader?{""extend"":{""en"":{""test"":""demo** and **""}}}**
* So, can't resolve '""}}}'

const help = `

const cli = meow(help, {argv: ['--root', 'foo']})

console.log(cli.input) // ['root', 'foo']

// What I'm seeing...
console.log(cli.flags) // {}
console.log(cli.input) // []

// Same applies to...

webpack-contrib_webpack-bundle-analyzer,332,Compiling Vue using modern mode causes an 'address in use' error when doing the second build.,"#### Issue description
The --modern flag in Vue allows you to build two projects - one with all of the necessary polyfills to allow older browsers to use your app, and a modern bundle which lacks then as well as various transpiling that modern browsers do not need.

This gives us the benefit of maintaining browser compatibility, but also slimming down the packages sometimes considerably for browsers that support certain features natively.

#### Technical info
* Webpack Bundle Analyzer version: 3.6.0
* Webpack version: 4.41.3
* Node.js version: 12.14.1
* npm version: 6.13.4
* OS: Windows 10

#### Debug info
How do you use this module? As CLI utility or as plugin?
Plugin

If CLI, what command was used? (e.g. `webpack-bundle-analyzer -O path/to/stats.json`)
npx vue-cli-service build --modern src/main.js

If plugin, what options were provided? (e.g. `new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({ analyzerMode: 'disabled', generateStatsFile: true })`)
No arguments.

What other Webpack plugins were used?
None

It would be nice to also attach webpack stats file.
It can be generated using these options:
```js
new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
  analyzerMode: 'disabled',
  generateStatsFile: true,
  // Excludes module sources from stats file so there won't be any sensitive data
  statsOptions: { source: false }
})
```
`stats.json` will be created in Webpack bundle output directory.

It's worth noting that the modern build overwrote the stats.json created in the legacy build. I've captured both by quickly copying the stats file before it got overwritten. I do not suspect these will be relevant though, as it doesn't seem like an issue specific to my project.

[stats.json.txt](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer/files/4227657/stats.json.txt)

yannickcr_eslint-plugin-react,1238,Allow jsx-no-bind to ignore dom components,"In my point of view the `jsx-no-bind` rule is mostly for `PureComponent`, although there is consideration on GC performance, it should not be significant

In many cases, we need to pass some arguments to an event handler, for example: 

```js
<li key={name} className={className} onClick={() => this.onClickTag(name, selected)}>{text}</li>
```

This will trigger the `jsx-no-bind` rule, here we have 2 concerns:

1. If we are using a custom component in above code, we can pass `name` and `selected` to component's `props` and call `this.props.onClick(this.props.name, this.props.selected)` to prevent such function bindings, however we cannot do this with DOM components
2. DOM components are never `PureComponent`, so a large reason for `jsx-no-bind` rule will not be a benefit for DOM components

For these reasons, I expect the `jsx-no-bind` can have a `ignoreDOMComponents` config to ignore function bindings on DOM components",https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/1238,Not  a Bug,,

### Expected Behavior

`Test` class is exported as both a named and default export when using the ""system"" format. This works correctly in the other formats or when `Test` is a function instead of a class.

### Actual Behavior

Only the `default` export is created.

MoOx_reduce-css-calc,38,Incorrect reduction of nested expression,"Reducing the expression `calc( (1em - calc( 10px + 1em)) / 2)` reduces incorrectly to `calc(1em - 5px)` (the correct one should be `-5px`).

A workaround is to add another operation, however this is far from ideal: `calc( (1em + (-1 * calc( 10px + 1em))) / 2)`.

        },
        data: {
          email: this.email,
          post_id: this.selectedPostID
        }
      })
      .then(response => {
        console.log(response)
      })
      .catch(e => {
        this.error = true;
})
```

The issue is that ""params"" is being ignored and the url remains untouched. However if I do a ""get"" request it works fine and the url is properly adjusted. Any reason behind this? Or is my code wrong?

In my case I would have to remove ""ajaxurl"" and replace it with 

`ajaxurl + '?action=' + 'am_send_test'` but I assumed params would work anyways.

gulp-sourcemaps_gulp-sourcemaps,33,Source Maps Not Working for SCSS,"## Issue

The inline source maps generated for scss are not valid. If I replace the inline data with a different plugins source map, everything works fine (not chrome configuration issue).

        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(sass())

```

I have also tried several variations, including:

```
gulp.task('css:dev', function () {
    return gulp.src('public/css/**/core.scss')
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(autoprefix({

            console.error(error);

        })
        .pipe(gulp.dest('public/build/css/'))
        .pipe(livereload({auto: false}));

If I decode the base64, it seems to only be capturing the core.css file which is the compiled file.

JeffreyWay_laravel-mix,1577,Bug: Scoped package dependency in mix extension is not recognized.,"<!-- 
    Before posting this issue, please perform the following steps, and confirm that the issue is still present.

1. Update Laravel Mix to the latest version. (`npm update laravel-mix` or `yarn upgrade laravel-mix --latest`)
2. Nuke your dependencies, and reinstall from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
3. Check your `package.json` file, and ensure that there are no old Laravel Elixir dependencies that might be interfering with Mix.
-->

- Laravel Mix Version: laravel-mix@2.1.11
- Node Version: v8.10.0
- NPM Version: 5.7.1
- OS: Fedora 27

### Description:
I'm trying to build a custom extension for laravel-mix which has few dependencies. These dependencies are scoped packages (i.e they begin with '@' symbol) e.g. `@fortawesome/fontawesome`.

Mix fails to recognize these scoped packages were already installed during the first run of the custom extension. So it tries to re-install them on consecutive run and gets stuck at this stage as I have set `this.requiresReload` to `true`.

> I have found the cause for this bug and will send a PR soon.

### Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create sample mix extension with scoped packages
```
let mix = require('laravel-mix');

class FontAwesome {
    dependencies () {
        this.requiresReload = true;

        return [ '@fortawesome/fontawesome' ];
    }
};

mix.extend('fontAwesome', new FontAwesome());
```
2. Add custom extension to the mix build chain in webpack.mix.js
```
require('<custom-extension-name>');

mix.js('resources/assets/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .sass('resources/assets/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
    .fontAwesome();
```
3. Run Mix using `npm run dev`

> It logs `Additional dependencies must be installed. This will only take a moment.` and installs the necessary dependencies (in this case `@fortawesome/fontawesome`)
> Then asks to re-run Mix. This is expected behaviour thus far.

4. But after re-run `npm run dev`

> It still cannot find the scoped package and tries to install it again which is unnecessary.
> It again asks to re-run Mix as I have set `this.requiresReload = true`. This creates a loop and never gets past this stage of loading dependencies.",https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/1577,Intrinsic,,
